There are an estimated 38 million people [31.6 millionâ€“44.5 million] living with HIV in 2019.  In most countries, the disease is concentrated in three high risk groups:
\begin{itemize}
\item drug users 
\item commercial sex workers
\item men who have sex with men 
\end{itemize}
\vfill
Better information about these group can be used to understand and control the spread of HIV/AIDS: ``know your epidemic''
\end{frame}

Two main questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item prevalence of some trait within a hidden population (e.g., What proportion of sex workers in Moscow have HIV/AIDS?): \pause respondent-driven sampling (lecture 13) \pause
\item size of hidden population (e.g., How many sex workers are there in Moscow?) \pause network scale-up method (this lecture)

Other size estimation methods are problematic, and scale-up method has many nice properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item Requires a random sample of the general population, not specific contact with the hard-to-reach population \pause
\item Can be added as a module (5-10 minutes) in any existing survey \pause
\item Can estimate many target populations in a single survey \pause
\item Can be applied at the city-level, sub-national-level, or national-level \pause
\item Statistical methods are improvable \pause

In previous classes, we tried a survey experiment as a homework assignment in this class.  
\begin{itemize}
\item We wanted to estimate number of people dating someone from their high school and number of people dating someone from Rutgers.
\item We asked about connections to 9 groups of known size (e.g., sociology majors).
\item We used 4 definitions of to know:
\begin{enumerate}
\item shared a meal with yesterday
\item shared a meal with in the past seven days
\item shared a meal with this semester
\item shared a meal with this academic year
\end{enumerate}
