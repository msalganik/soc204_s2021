There are an estimated 38 million people [31.6 millionâ€“44.5 million] living with HIV in 2019.  In most countries, the disease is concentrated in three high risk groups:
\begin{itemize}
\item drug users 
\item commercial sex workers
\item men who have sex with men 
\end{itemize}
\vfill
Better information about these group can be used to understand and control the spread of HIV/AIDS: ``know your epidemic''
\end{frame}

Two main questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item prevalence of some trait within a hidden population (e.g., What proportion of sex workers in Moscow have HIV/AIDS?): \pause respondent-driven sampling (lecture 13) \pause
\item size of hidden population (e.g., How many sex workers are there in Moscow?) \pause network scale-up method (this lecture)
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Requires a random sample from the entire population 
\item Respondents are asked:
\begin{itemize}
\item How many people do you know who are drug injectors? 
\item How many women do you know that have given birth in the last 12 months?
\item How many people do you know who are middle school teachers?
\item $\ldots$
\item How many people do you know named Michael?
\end{itemize}
\item ``Know'' typically defined: you know them and they know you and have you been in contact with them over the past two years

Other size estimation methods are problematic, and scale-up method has many nice properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item Requires a random sample of the general population, not specific contact with the hard-to-reach population \pause
\item Can be added as a module (5-10 minutes) in any existing survey \pause
\item Can estimate many target populations in a single survey \pause
\item Can be applied at the city-level, sub-national-level, or national-level \pause
\item Statistical methods are improvable \pause
\item Partially self-validating because it uses groups of known size
\end{itemize}

\item We develop the generalized scale-up estimator and use it to point out possible biases in basic scale-up estimator, but requires two data collections, which is rare (but wait until lecture 23) \pause
\item For the purposes of this class, focus on basic scale-up estimator and the correction factors needed for it

\item Are there tie definitions other than ``to know'' that would lead to better estimates? We did a survey experiment to compare different definitions and then combined them to produce a single estimate \pause
\item Notice how we decided which is better and how we combined estimates \pause
\item Notice how we dealt with the many things we did not know with sensitivity analysis.
