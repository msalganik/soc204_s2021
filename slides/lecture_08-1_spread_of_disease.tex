\item help
\item hurt

Depends on the disease. for example travel is especially bad for diseases with long incubation period and asymptomatic spread

Important to match the disease you are studying to the appropriate contact network.  For STDs, this is the sexual network.

Recall, this image of the sexual networks in Sweden.

But what is the structure of sexual networks?
