\note{

Bearman et al. studies a school in the US.  Helleringer et al are interested in sub-Saharan Africa.  About two-thirds of the worlds HIV cases are in sub-Saharan Africa and patterns of infection are different there than in other countries.  UNAIDS divides countries into no epidemic, concentrated epidemic, and generalized epidemic.  Malawi has a generalized epidemic.  That is why information about the structure of the sexual network in the general population is so important.  Also, there is something of a puzzle about why HIV rates are so much higher in sub-Saharan Africa.  This is part of trying to figure that out.

Basically, the do a network census on an island (Fig.~\ref{fig:likoma_map}).  Like Bearman et al. they find one giant component but it includes more cycles than the spanning tree in the high school. (Figure~\ref{fig:helleringer_sexual_2007_fig2a}).

Summary:
\begin{itemize}
\item contact patterns are important for the spread of disease
\pause
\item sometimes detailed complete network structure matters

\item simple rules by individuals can aggregate to complex network patterns
